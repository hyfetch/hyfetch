## Heyo, I'm Mero!  
You might recognize me by other names like hyfetch, or maybe something else.  
I'm a software engineering student with a focus on full-stack development, and I’m particularly passionate about building connections with Discord. :3  
In my free time, I dive into cybersecurity, malware reverse engineering, and anti-phishing work.
